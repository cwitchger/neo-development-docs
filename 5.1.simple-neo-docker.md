## Docker NEO privatenet

The NEO Docker image allows us to build and run an equivalent to the NEO Test Net locally. This can be helpful during the development process to test code changes or even experiment with what is possible without spending any TestNet GAS.

> **What is Docker?**
> If you are not familiar with Docker, I recommend reading the article: https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/. Docker rests on top of an OS and enables you to run applications in separate environments called containers. These containers are not VMs, so they can be started quickly and can use minimal system resources.

If you do not already have Docker installed on your system, you can download it for Mac at: ```https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac```.
Or for Windows at: ```https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/```

### Docker NEO Private Net (Simple Setup)
For a simple setup, use Kitematic, a tool built by Docker to easily interact with your containers.
* In Kitematic, select the **+ New** button to create a container.
* Search for ```neo-privatenet``` and press the **CREATE** button. Although this container is not a VM, there are still some resources that need to be downloaded. It may take several minutes the first time you create the container.
* While waiting for the container to be built, select the three dots (**...**) next to the create button and click **VIEW ON DOCKER HUB** to load the docs for this project. Alternatively, follow this link: https://hub.docker.com/r/cityofzion/neo-privatenet/
  - The README is a quick read and contains valuable information
* For now, all we need is the wallet, which can be downloaded here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/neo-experiments/neo-privnet.wallet (password: ```coz```). This wallet contains all of the NEO in the ```privatenet``` and plenty of GAS to use for testing. We will be using this file in: **Executing the Smart Contract with NEO Python**

**Checking the Connection:** If you cannot connect, make sure the ports are set up correctly. With the container selected in Kitematic, select Settings > Ports. The list of Docker Ports and the Mac Ports should be the same for all eight ports.

If you are interested in setting up the container from the Docker project, you can follow the instructions: [Advanced NEO Docker Setup](5.2.advanced-neo-docker.md)

**Note:** Although the quick ```privatenet``` Docker image and the custom ```privnet``` Docker images have different names, the default is to map the containers' ports to the same local ports on your machine. Docker will select new ports if there is a conflict; however, this will likely not have the intended result. I recommend either running the ```privatenet``` or the custom ```privnet``` Docker container.
