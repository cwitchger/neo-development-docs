### Docker NEO Privnet (Advanced: Custom Setup)

Now that you have installed Docker for Mac, we can download the ```neo-privnet-docker``` project from Github.
I suggest using my fork for Mac users, located here: https://github.com/cwitchger/neo-privatenet-docker or you can download the full version here: https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-privatenet-docker. The primary differences are the config files for the neo-cli nodes. I have also added a script to make generating GAS a little easier.

To build, start building the Docker image:
```
cd neo-privnet-docker
./docker-build.sh
```

> **Note:** You can add the flag ```--no-cache``` when running ```docker-build.sh``` to skip docker's local cache and build the container from scratch.

While the container is being built, here are a few commands that may be useful:
* List all active Docker containers: ```docker container ls --all```
* Remove Docker container: ```docker container rm <container ID or image name>```
* Start Docker container: ```docker container start <container ID or image name>```
* Stop Docker container: ```docker container stop <container ID or image name>```
* Help with Docker commands: ```docker --help```

Once the Docker image is finished being built, you should see: **Successfully tagged neo-privnet:latest**

To start the container, run:
```
./docker_run_and_create_wallet.sh
```
This will also create a wallet with all of the NEO on the Private Net, as well as a little GAS to work with.

After a few minutes you should see this message:
```
Copying wallet file and wif key out of Docker container...

--------------------

All done! You now have 2 files in the current directory:

  neo-privnet.wallet .. a wallet you can use with neo-python (pwd: coz)
  neo-privnet.wif ..... a wif private key you can import into other clients

Enjoy!
```

#### Check Node Status
In your ```neo-privnet-docker``` folder, you should see a newly added file called: ```neo-privnet.wallet``` You will be using this wallet in the next step.

To check that the nodes are running, connect to the container:
```
docker exec -it neo-privnet /bin/bash
```
> **Note:** You connected to a bash editor for the container so you can explore using all of your favorite Linux commands.

To see the console output for the nodes that are running, execute:
```
screen -ls
```
> **Note:** To troubleshoot a node, you can connect to that screen using: ```screen -r node1```

#### Creating NEO GAS to Work With
**cwitchger/neo-privatenet-docker fork**

* If you are using the fork I created, execute the script to create more NEO GAS:
```
docker exec -it neo-privnet /bin/bash /neo-python/generate_gas.sh
```
This will call the script for generating GAS an additional 10 times to create enough GAS to deploy a few Smart Contracts. This will run for several minutes; however, you can continue with this tutorial in a different terminal window.

**CityOfZion/neo-privatenet-docker Fork**
* If you are using the standard image, connect to bash terminal:
```
docker exec -it neo-privnet /bin/bash
```
Change the permissions of the file so that it is executable, and execute:
```
chmod 755 claim_gas_fixedwallet.py
./claim_gas_fixedwallet.py
```
