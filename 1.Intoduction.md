## Introduction

### NEO Smart Contract Background
Although Smart Contracts can be written in many different languages for NEO, they are all compiled into the same byte code format called AVM. This AVM byte code is run on the NEO VirtualMachine. Whether you are writing in Python, Java, or C#, they will all be compiled into the same AVM file so that it can be run on the NEO Blockchain.

There are a few tools that we will use to help turn our Java source code into AVM byte code.

#### NeoJ Compiler
The ```neoj``` compiler is written in C# and takes a ```jar``` or Java ```class file``` as input and converts it to AVM byte code. The compiler catches typical compile time issues, such as unsupported data types, unsupported function calls, etc. For example, you cannot use the Java library class ```java.util.Map```; the ```neoj``` compiler would throw an error. On that note, although a Java Map isn't supported, you can use a NEO specific Map, which has the most widely-used methods for Maps.

#### NEO Java Dev Pack (neo-devpack-java)
The Java dev pack contains many of the declarations for native method calls for interacting with the NEO API (http://docs.neo.org/en-us/sc/reference/api.html). The API is separated into two namespaces: NEO and System. These contain functions for storing data on the blockchain, verifying callers, etc. In addition, there are utilities for converting and working with various datatypes, such as byte arrays. During development, we can use the native methods and annotations defined in the dev pack to express the functionality of our Smart Contract. These native methods and annotations will be used by the ```neoj``` compiler  to convert our Java source code into AVM byte code.

**Note:** During development, it can be helpful to first look at the [NEO API](http://docs.neo.org/en-us/sc/reference/api.html) and then review the corresponding method in the NEO Java dev pack.

#### TestNet on Docker
The folks at CoZ have made a Docker container for running a TestNet locally. This Docker container allows us to create a NEO network  locally with a click of a button. This is great for testing and debugging issues as they arise.

#### Smart Contract Execution
Testing is important during all software development. To test the Smart Contract, we are going to pair the NEO Docker image along with the ```neo-python``` CLI tool. Although we could deploy on TestNet, it is faster for us, and nicer to the community, to do simple testing locally before deploying on TestNet.

In the subsequent sections, I will walk through setting up each of these components.
