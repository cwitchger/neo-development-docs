## Executing the Smart Contract with NEO Python
With the ```neo-python``` CLI active, we can now begin executing commands on the local NEO Net we have created.

#### Open wallet
In order to execute any commands on the NEO CLI, we will need to open a wallet:
```
open wallet neo-privnet.wallet
```

When prompted for the password, enter: ```coz```. We will use this password each time we execute a transaction in the NEO CLI.

**NOTE:** You will need to wait a few minutes for the local chain to sync. You will know this is complete when the two numbers at the bottom of the terminal window are the same. Example:```1298/1298```

#### Import a Smart Contract
When importing a Smart Contract, we will provide five parameters in the following order:

```
import contract *.avm {input_params} {return_type} {needs_storage} {needs_dynamic_invoke}
```
1. The .avm file we would like to import
2. Input parameters - explained here: http://docs.neo.org/en-us/sc/Parameter.html
3. The expected response type for the contract - explained here: http://docs.neo.org/en-us/sc/Parameter.html
4. Whether the contract requires storage
5. If Dynamic invocation is necessary

We can import the token we created using:
```
import contract ico-template-1.0.0.avm 0710 05 True False
```
You will be prompted to enter a few fields following the import contract invocation:
```
[Contract Name] > MyToken
[Contract Version] > <blank>
[Contract Author] > <blank>
[Contract Email] > <blank>
[Contract Description] > <blank>
```

After entering the above values when prompted, you will then see the output:
```
Creating Smart Contract....
                 Name: MyToken
              Version:
               Author:  
                Email:  
          Description:  
        Needs Storage: True
 Needs Dynamic Invoke: False

 {
    "hash": "0x14a36a541e08afd83d01f7d7c12900be8e4b281f",

    ...
```

**Note:** The contract hash: ```0x14a36a541e08afd83d01f7d7c12900be8e4b281f``` will be used when invoking the Smart Contract. You will want to save the value at this point.

At the end of the output, you will be asked to enter the wallet password (```coz```):
```
...

Enter your password to continue and deploy this contract
[password]> coz
```

After entering the password, you will see two output lines similar to the following;
```
[I 180830 19:02:02 Transaction:615] Verifying transaction: b'44ac98b0f7acd4da604f1b54e1b82f6455c2c6c8307a9853310da1955b04c379'
Relayed Tx: 44ac98b0f7acd4da604f1b54e1b82f6455c2c6c8307a9853310da1955b04c379
```
The *transaction hash* is after ```Relayed Tx: ``` and in this example that value is: ```44ac98b0f7acd4da604f1b54e1b82f6455c2c6c8307a9853310da1955b04c379```

#### Check the Status of the Transaction

To check the status of your transaction, use the hash found from the *import contract* command:
```
tx <transaction hash>
```

---

#### Search for the contract
Another way to see if the contract has been posted is to search for the token with the following command:
```
contract search MyToken
```

In the output you should see something like the snippet of output below:
```
...
{
    "hash": "0x14a36a541e08afd83d01f7d7c12900be8e4b281f",
...
```
In this example, the contract hash ```0x14a36a541e08afd83d01f7d7c12900be8e4b281f```

#### Deploy the Smart Contract Token

Now that our Smart Contract has been imported to the NEO blockchain, we can begin executing the functions that are built in to this NEP5 token.

> To meet the requirements for the [NEP5 Specification](https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/blob/master/nep-5.mediawiki), the following functions must be built in to the Smart Contract: totalSupply, name, symbol, decimals, balanceOf, and transfer. These functions can be called at any time once the Smart Contract has been imported.

The first function we will execute on our Smart Contract will allow for trading and tracking of our newly created token:

```
testinvoke <contract hash> deploy []
```

> Note: Even if there are no additional parameters that need to be passed to our Smart Contract, we must pass an empty array. This is because when we first created our Smart Contract, we specified that the input parameter was an array. In the code itself, we also expect an array of objects: ```public static Object Main(String operation, Object[] args)```

---

#### Mint Tokens

The mint tokens function is what we will use to convert from NEO to the token we have created. To execute this command, we will still provide the operation name and the arguments but we will also add an additional parameter to attach NEO from the wallet to the execution of the command:

```
testinvoke <contract hash> mintTokens [] --attach-neo=100
```

> Note: Due to the way the Smart Contract is written, once NEO is sent to a Smart Contract, it cannot be returned, even in the event that there is an error in the process. A common resolution is to allow for return of the funds.

---

#### Import the token into your wallet

Now that we have traded NEO for our token, we should be able to see the token in our wallet. If we simply run the ```wallet``` command, we will see that NEO was taken out of our wallet but we will not see the new token that we have just created. In order for it to appear in our wallet, we must first import the token:

```
import token <contract hash>
```

Once the token is imported, we should see it in our wallet. To do this we can run the wallet command again:
```
wallet
```

---

#### Additional ```neo-python``` Functions

The ```neo-python``` CLI has many capabilities. A few common examples are listed below:

**Rebuilding wallet**

If the CLI tool is out of sync with the Docker container, you may not be able to invoke a Smart Contract. To resolve this, rebuild the wallet:

```
wallet rebuild
wallet
```

**Turn on log events**

If you are trying to debug an issue with your Smart Contract, you can enable logging for the Smart Contract:

```
config sc-events on
```

**Help**

The most useful command is the help command, which will print out all of the possible commands for the CLI tool.

```
help
```

---


#### Other Smart Contract Functions
* Total supply: ```testinvoke <contract hash> totalSupply []```
* Symbol: ```testinvoke <contract hash> symbol []```
* Decimals: ```testinvoke <contract hash> decimals []```
* Balance of the token: ```testinvoke <contract hash> balanceOf ["<token hash>"]```
* Transfering assets: ```testinvoke <contract hash> transfer ["<token hash>","<To wallet address>","<amount>"]```

> *Note:* We are connecting to the Docker container using ```neo-python```. When errors arise from running ```testinvoke``` or other commands, these are ```neo-python``` errors and not issues with ```neo```. Here is an example that caught me off guard: When executing a Smart Contract, I was seeing the error ```neo StateReader:348] Cannot serialize item StackItem: Not Supported to Serialize Map: StackItem```. When I checked the line number for that file in the ```neo``` project, I landed here: ```https://github.com/neo-project/neo/blob/master/neo/SmartContract/StateReader.cs#L348```, which did not make sense. However, because I was running from ```neo-python```, when I searched for that error in the ```neo-python``` project, it led me here: ```https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python/blob/v0.6.7/neo/SmartContract/StateReader.py#L348```, which made a lot more sense.

## Congratulations!
Now what? If you went through every step of this tutorial, your system is ready for development of your own Smart Contract. I would recommend looking though the source code from the Smart Contract example. There are plenty of comments and examples of various operations. A good first step may be adding a few log statements so that you can see exactly what the Smart Contract is doing.

If you have questions, feel free to reach out on Discord on the #Java space, or to me directly at @witchger.
