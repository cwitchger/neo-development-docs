## Setting up NeoJ Compiler

In order to run the ```neoj``` compiler, we must first install .Net Core. You can download **.Net Core SDK** at https://www.microsoft.com/net/download.  The default configuration will work.

* On Mac, open the **dotnet-sdk-2.1.400-osx-x64.pkg** and click through the install steps.
* On Windows, open the **dotnet-sdk-2.1.401-win-x64.exe** and click through the install steps.

> I recommend downloading the .Net IDE, Visual Studio, as well. It may be useful in the future when you are trying to debug an error or trying to better understand the ```neoj``` compiler. Whether you are on a Mac, PC, or Linux machine, you can download and run Visual Studio (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).

Once .Net Core is installed, you will need to clone or download the ```neo-compiler``` from Github, which can be found here: https://github.com/neo-project/neo-compiler.

> I recommend cloning this and all repositories in this tutorial so that you can easily update them in the future.

```
git clone https://github.com/neo-project/neo-compiler.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can navigate into the ```neo-compiler/neoj/``` folder and build the workspace with the following command:

```
cd neo-compiler/neoj
dotnet build
```

After a few moments, you should see the success message: ```Build succeeded.```

**Error Resolution**

* When you are running the ```neoj``` compiler, you may see the following error:
```
It was not possible to find any compatible framework version
The specified framework 'Microsoft.NETCore.App', version '1.0.4' was not found.
 - Check application dependencies and target a framework version installed at:
    /
 - Alternatively, install the framework version '1.0.4'.
```
To resolve this error, you must update the ```neoj``` project file to look for the latest version of .Net. To do this, open the file ```neo-compiler/neoj/neoj.csproj```
and update the parameter **RuntimeFrameworkVersion** to use the latest version.
Example:
```
<RuntimeFrameworkVersion>2.0.6</RuntimeFrameworkVersion>
```

If you are able to run the ```dotnet build``` command without issues, we can move on to setting up the NEO dev pack for Java. We will be using the ```neoj``` compiler again in the next few sections, so it is important that you can run the build command.
