## Build the Template ICO
Now that we have successfully setup our environment to compile our Java Smart Contract project in to the AVM format, we can build our first Smart Contract using the Java examples.

Clone the ```examples-java``` project from NEO:
```
git clone https://github.com/neo-project/examples-java
```

Run maven package to build the jar so that we can pass it to the ```neoj``` compiler:
```
cd examples-java/ico-template
mvn clean package
```
**Note: ico-template is dependent on ```neo-devpack-java```. If you did not run a ```mvn clean install``` in the ```neo-devpack-java``` folder, this call will fail.**

### Adding Maven Projects to Eclipse
We can import both the ```neo-devpack-java``` and ```ico-template``` projects into Eclipse, as they are standard Java projects.

In Eclipse, navigate to **File > import...** and select **Existing Maven Projects**. Locate the folders for the two projects and press **Finish**. They should build in Eclipse.

At this point, I recommend reading through some of the comments in the code. Start with ```ICOTemplate.java``` and reference ```TemplateToken.java``` and ```NEP5Template.java```, when applicable.

> **Advanced Setup**
>
> I am a supporter of scripts, so in the folder ```examples-java/ico-template/scripts/``` you will find a bash script called ```promote.sh.```. At the top of the script, I have parameterized the key variables. Depending on your project structure, you may want to update some of these variables so that you can simply run the promote script to package the jar; convert the jar to AVM byte code; and, lastly, place the AVM file in your NEO Python folder for testing on a local test net.

```
artifactId=ico-template
version=1.0.0
jarFile=$artifactId-$version.jar
neocompilerLocation=../../neo-compiler
neoj=$neocompilerLocation/neoj
neopythonLocation=~/Documents/neo-python/
```

The two variables you will likely need to change are: ```neocompilerLocation``` and ```neopythonLocation```.

### Building the AVM byte code from the Java Package
**Check point**
If you have followed the instructions up to this point, you should have the following:
* ```dotnet``` installed, and the ```neoj```, ```neo-compiler``` downloaded and running
* ```neo-devpack-java``` built successfully and the jar placed in the following two locations for Mac users:
  - There should be a file located at: ```/usr/local/share/dotnet/org.neo.smartcontract.framework.jar```
  - There should also be a compiled maven artifact (jar in your ```.m2``` folder) at: ```~/.m2/repository/org/neo/neo-devpack-java/2.3.0/neo-devpack-java-2.3.0.jar```
* packaged ico-template for examples-java
  - ```examples-java/ico-template/target/ico-template-1.0.0-.jar```

Given that the above steps are complete, move the ```ico-template``` jar in to your ```neo-compiler``` ```neoj``` folder.
```
cp examples-java/ico-template/target/ico-template-1.0.0-.jar neo-compiler/neoj
```

To begin the conversion process, execute:
```
dotnet run ico-template-1.0.0-.jar
```

Once it has finished, you should see:
```
Neo.Compiler.JVM console app v2.0.3.0
Find entrypoint:org.ico.main.ICOTemplate::Main(Ljava.lang.String;[Ljava.lang.Object;)Ljava.lang.Object;
convert succ
write:ico-template-1.0.0.avm
SUCC
```

You should also have a file in the ```neoj``` folder called: ```ico-template-1.0.0.avm```. We will be using this file in: [Executing the Smart Contract with NEO Python](7.smart-contract-execution.md)

> In the case of a failure, check the steps at the top of this section to ensure you have everything set up correctly.
