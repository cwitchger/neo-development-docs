## Setting up NEO Python CLI

**Check point**
* At this point, you should have Docker installed and a NEO container running. To check this, execute: ```docker container ls --all```
* If you followed the simple Docker setup, you should have a wallet file from https://s3.amazonaws.com/neo-experiments/neo-privnet.wallet called ```neo-privnet.wallet```
  - If you followed the advanced Docker setup, you should have a file that you generated from the: ```./docker_run_and_create_wallet.sh``` script called ```neo-privnet.wallet```. Note the default name for the file is the same as the simple setup; however, they have different hashes.
* You should have the file ```ico-template-1.0.0.avm``` in your ```neo-compiler``` folder.

In order to interact with the NEO local TestNet, we can use the NEO Python CLI tool. There are instructions for all systems in the README for the project found here: https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python. Otherwise, if you would like to follow along with the Mac instructions, I will provide them below.

Clone the ```neo-python``` project from CityOfZion:
```
git clone https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python.git
cd neo-python
```

If you are not familiar with the package manager built for Mac, called ```brew```, or not familiar with package managers, I suggest reading into it further: https://docs.brew.sh.

For now, we can install ```brew``` with the following command
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Now that ```brew``` is installed we can download a few dependencies needed for running neo-python:
```
brew install leveldb
```

**Recommended Step**
For both of these files, we could reference them from their original file locations. However, I find this makes the commands hard to follow. For the purposes of this tutorial, I will recommend copying them in to the ```neo-python``` folder directly.

Copy the ```neo-privnet.wallet``` file that we created in an earlier step into the ```neo-python``` folder:
```
cp ~/Downloads/neo-privnet.wallet neo-python/.
```

Copy the ```ico-template-1.0.0.avm``` to the *neo-python* folder:
```
cp neo-compiler/neoj/ico-template-1.0.0.avm neo-python/.
```
---

Now that we have the files located in a straightforward location, we can run ```neo-python``` with a few simple commands. Every time you want to start up ```neo-python```, I recommend executing these commands in order (or you can use the script that I provide later on).

Create a virtual environment for Python to run in and activate it:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

It is recommended to always use a script like this when working with Python:
```
# install the package in an editable form
pip install neo-python
```

Now that the dependancies are installed, we can start it using:
```
np-prompt -p
```
**Note:** The ```-p``` flag tells ```neo-python``` that we want to connect to a local private TestNet.

> **Development Note**
>
> Every time I start NEO Docker I use a script so that I start from a clean chain. Although this may not be desirable for everyone, I find it useful:
* Removes the old ```privnet``` chain
* Starts ```neo-python```

```bash
#bin/bash
docker start neo-privatenet

cd neo-python

rm -rf ~/.neopython/Chains/privnet*

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install neo-python
np-prompt -p
```
