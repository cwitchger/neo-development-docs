## Setting up neo-devpack-java

The ```neo-devpack-java``` project is used at two different points in the development of a Smart Contract. First, it will be used as a dependency in the Java project for the Smart Contract. We will use these native methods and annotations to express the logic for the Smart Contract in Java syntax. Second, it will be used as a dependency during compile time for the ```neoj``` compiler.

In order for ```neo-devpack-java``` to be found by our maven project, we must place the jar into our local maven ```.m2``` folder. This will be done with a maven install command. In order for ```neo-devpack-java``` to be used by ```neoj```, we will also place the jar in the .Net home folder so that it can be automatically accessed during each execution of the ```neoj``` compiler.

Clone the Java dev pack repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/neo-project/neo-devpack-java.git
```

To build and store the compiled jar into our local m2 folder, navigate to the ```neo-devpack-java/``` repository and run:
```
cd neo-devpack-java/
mvn clean install
```

It's important to note that when running the ```neoj``` compiler, you must either provide the jar for ```neo-devpack-java``` or put it in your dotnet execution folder. In this tutorial, we will put it in our .NET folder. The ```neoj``` compiler looks for a package named ```org.neo.smartcontract.framework.jar``` and will make the methods in that package available for all projects that are compiled using the ```neoj``` compiler.

When placing the jar in the .Net home folder, we must name the file ```org.neo.smartcontract.framework.jar```.

On a Mac, the folder is located at ```/usr/local/share/dotnet/org.neo.smartcontract.framework.jar```.

To copy the compiled jar, execute:
```
cd neo-devpack-java/
sudo cp target/neo-devpack-java-2.3.0.jar /usr/local/share/dotnet/org.neo.smartcontract.framework.jar
```

For Windows users, I recommend using the NEO documentation found here, which explains where the fie should be put: http://docs.neo.org/en-us/sc/quickstart/getting-started-java.html#development-tools

___

For Mac users, you can use this bash script to place the jar in the .Net home folder.
Simply create a file called ```promote.sh``` in the ```neo-devpack-java``` folder and copy the script below:
```bash
#bin/bash

artifactId=neo-devpack-java
version=2.3.0
jarFile=$artifactId-$version.jar
macDotNetFolder=/usr/local/share/dotnet/
dotnetJarFileName=org.neo.smartcontract.framework.jar

mvn clean install

cd target/
sudo cp $jarFile $macDotNetFolder/$dotnetJarFileName
```

### Verify the dependencies for building a Smart Contract
* There should be a jar (maven artifact) in your ```~/.m2``` folder: ```~/.m2/repository/org/neo/neo-devpack-java/2.3.0/neo-devpack-java-2.3.0.jar```
* For Mac users, there should be a file located at: ```/usr/local/share/dotnet/org.neo.smartcontract.framework.jar```
* For Windows users, there should be a file located at: ```\neoj\bin\Release\netcoreapp1.1\win10-x64\publish\org.neo.smartcontract.framework.jar```
